Welcome to my Substack.</p> <p>I started a blog briefly during the first COVID-19 lockdown because like everybody else, I was bored out of my mind. Blogs seemed to be outdated though, and I decided to jump in on the podcasting bandwagon. However, with the ever increasing workload that comes with pursuing two undergraduate degrees simulatenously, I had to eventually call it quits - inviting guests, recording episodes, editing them and then posting them was all too time consuming, and the opportunity cost was not worth it at that time.</p> <p>Now, while my academics are still a priority, I believe it is also important for me to share my thoughts with the world. Everytime I see something amazing, interesting, controversial or even downright stupid, my brain gets overwhelmed. I write these thoughts down often using the ever handy ‘Notes’ app on my phone, but I also wonder how many other people would have similar thoughts. So while a blog’s purpose is usually to write about things other people are interested in, the purpose of this blog is for me to share thoughts that I have, in the hope that other people who have them would be interested in knowing that they are not alone.</p> <p>I wrote a couple of posts directly on my website, but when sharing it with a few friends, they expressed a desire to automatically receive an email when I write something new. This was the same feedback I got when I used to maintain my earlier blog. Hence, this Substack was born.</p> <p>Thanks for reading this so far, and I hope you stick around!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[please do subscribe :)]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">(don’t) be yourself</title><link href="https://harasiddh.github.io/blog/2025/reinventing-yourself/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="(don’t) be yourself"/><published>2025-02-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://harasiddh.github.io/blog/2025/reinventing-yourself</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://harasiddh.github.io/blog/2025/reinventing-yourself/"><![CDATA[<center> <div class="substack-post-embed"><p lang="en">(don’t) be yourself by Harasiddh G</p><p></p><a data-post-link="" href="https://monkofalltrades.substack.com/p/reinventing-yourself">Read on Substack</a></div><script async="" src="https://substack.com/embedjs/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </center> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I have never really agreed with the phrase “just be yourself” until recently.</p> <p>Certain events have required me to change a lot about the way I operate and live, and NGL, I struggled with the change. I used to keep wondering “Why me?” or “Why do I need to change?” because I felt the urge to just be myself.</p> <p>Then for some reason, the social media algorithm worked magic. Showed me a clip of Ronaldo, and most importantly, it showed the change before and after 2014. Everyone who’s an avid football fan knows about the <a href="https://www.sportbible.com/football/cristiano-ronaldo-has-an-injury-condition-with-no-cure-20220417">knee injury</a> that required him to move from the tricky winger to formidable goal poacher. Lot of people used to mock him for the transition, but it was forced upon him if he wanted to continue playing at the highest level.</p> <p>So he could have chosen to complain and moan about it, or he could accept reality and become the best poacher the world has ever seen.</p> <p>More than a decade after the injury, even his biggest critics would have to admit that he did exactly the latter. Driving Real Madrid towards the three-peat, Ronaldo would score everytime they needed a goal. The hattricks against Wolfsburg, Bayern and Atlético, that header against PSG in the return leg where he appeared like a tower of terror among the smoke, that penalty right at the death against Juventus, and that iconic goal in the first leg…he was simply spectacular. His exploits with Portugal were even more impressive considering the difference in quality of teammates - that header against Wales en route to glory at Euro 2016, and that iconic hattrick against Spain in the World Cup.</p> <p>All this because Ronaldo did not resist the need to reinvent himself. Be like Ronaldo. Don’t be yourself when reinvention is the need of the hour.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[when reinvention is required]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The best set of New Year’s Resolutions</title><link href="https://harasiddh.github.io/blog/2025/hardy-new-year-resolutions/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The best set of New Year’s Resolutions"/><published>2025-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://harasiddh.github.io/blog/2025/hardy-new-year-resolutions</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://harasiddh.github.io/blog/2025/hardy-new-year-resolutions/"><![CDATA[<center> <div class="substack-post-embed"><p lang="en">The best set of New Year’s Resolutions by Harasiddh G</p><p></p><a data-post-link="" href="https://monkofalltrades.substack.com/p/hardy-new-year-resolutions">Read on Substack</a></div><script async="" src="https://substack.com/embedjs/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </center> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>GH Hardy, who was Ramanujan’s mentor, apparently sent the following list of resolutions to a friend via postcard:</p> <ol> <li><em>Prove the Riemann hypothesis</em></li> <li><em>Make 211 not out in the fourth innings of the last Test Match at the Oval</em></li> <li><em>Find an argument for the nonexistence of God which shall convince the general public</em></li> <li><em>Be the first man at the top of Mount Everest</em></li> <li><em>Be proclaimed the first president of the U.

Unless you’re the next GH Hardy) write something like <em>go to the gym every day</em></p> <p>I don’t think Hardy managed to achieve any of the above before he died, but atleast he failed at something big.

Welcome to my blog.</p> <p>I started a blog briefly during the first COVID-19 lockdown because like everybody else, I was bored out of my mind. Blogs seemed to be outdated though, and I decided to jump in on the podcasting bandwagon. However, with the ever increasing workload that comes with pursuing two undergraduate degrees simulatenously, I had to eventually call it quits - inviting guests, recording episodes, editing them and then posting them was all too time consuming, and the opportunity cost was not worth it at that time.</p> <p>Now, while my academics are still a priority, I believe it is also important for me to share my thoughts with the world. Everytime I see something amazing, interesting, controversial or even downright stupid, my brain gets overwhelmed. I write these thoughts down often using the ever handy ‘Notes’ app on my phone, but I also wonder how many other people would have similar thoughts. So while a blog’s purpose is usually to write about things other people are interested in, the purpose of this blog is for me to share thoughts that I have, in the hope that other people who have them would be interested in knowing that they are not alone.</p> <p>Thanks for reading this so far, and I hope you stick around!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[first post here]]></summary></entry></feed>

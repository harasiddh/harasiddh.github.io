I am currently an M1 Economics student at Toulouse School of Economics

Prior to TSE, I simultaneously pursued two undergraduate degrees - one in Economics from Shiv Nadar IOE and another in Data Science from IIT Madras

I believe that a life spent in the endless pursuit of knowledge is one worth living 

When not dealing with Economics or household chores, I like to read about ancient civilisations and watch English films

I believe that Test cricket is the best format of the game, and have supported Real Madrid since Ronaldo's iconic “calma, calma”

I am currently an M1 Economics student at [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/)

Prior to TSE, I was a Dean's List student of [Economics at Shiv Nadar IOE](https://snu.edu.in/schools/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/departments/department-of-economics/) while simultaneously pursuing an online degree in [Data Science from IIT Madras](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/)

I believe that a life spent in the endless pursuit of knowledge is one worth living

When not dealing with academics or household chores, I like to read about [ancient civilisations](https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2023/09/18/how-often-do-men-think-about-the-roman-empire-a-lot-according-to-new-tiktok-trend/) and watch [English films](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbBiXPVKuTA)

I feel that [Test cricket is the best format of the game](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/australia-tour-of-india-2000-01-61425/india-vs-australia-2nd-test-63920/full-scorecard), and have supported Real Madrid since Ronaldo's iconic [“calma, calma”](https://www.reddit.com/r/realmadrid/comments/cz2q6o/the_highlight_of_the_year_2012_calma_calma/)

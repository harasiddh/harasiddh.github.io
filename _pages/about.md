I am a fully-funded Masters student at [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/)

I am interested in problems where incentives, information, and institutions interact, especially in settings involving human capital

Prior to TSE, I was a Dean's List student of [Economics at Shiv Nadar IOE](https://snu.edu.in/schools/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/departments/department-of-economics/) while simultaneously pursuing an online degree in [Data Science from IIT Madras](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/)

My philosophy of life is simple: keep playing unfair games fairly without giving up

When not proving theorems or trying out new recipes, I like to read about [ancient civilisations](https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2023/09/18/how-often-do-men-think-about-the-roman-empire-a-lot-according-to-new-tiktok-trend/) and watch [documentaries on the animal kingdom](https://youtu.be/yfs6ef5YcFs)

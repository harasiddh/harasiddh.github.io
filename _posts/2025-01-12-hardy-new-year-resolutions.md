GH Hardy, who was Ramanujan's mentor, apparently sent the following list of resolutions to a friend via postcard:

1. *Prove the Riemann hypothesis*
2. *Make 211 not out in the fourth innings of the last Test Match at the Oval*
3. *Find an argument for the nonexistence of God which shall convince the general public*
4. *Be the first man at the top of Mount Everest*
5. *Be proclaimed the first president of the U. S. S. R. of Great Britain and Germany*
6. *Murder Mussolini*

And ordinary human beings like me (and maybe you? Unless you're the next GH Hardy) write something like *go to the gym every day*

I don't think Hardy managed to achieve any of the above before he died, but atleast he failed at something big. Meanwhile, I couldn't keep up with my resolution to drink 8 glasses of water a day (I drank 10 today)

I recently came across this video which really struck a chord in me - not because I think I am an overachiever of any sorts. But rather because I think it is something that all of us grapple with at some point or another in our lives

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

    </div>

Chris also touches upon something which I think perfectly describes how to know when you've achieved something - and it is something that I have come across before, but can't remember where exactly

It basically says that once you become successful or win at something on a regular basis, what ends up occuring is that eventually...those wins primarily make you feel a sense of *relief* and not *happiness*...

I have personally felt that on several occasions, and while I do think it's a good thing on an overall basis, I feel that it's not healthy in the long run. But what the hell, as Keynes once said - "*In the long run, we are all dead*"

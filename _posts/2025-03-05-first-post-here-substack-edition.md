Hi! Welcome to my Substack.

I started a blog briefly during the first COVID-19 lockdown because like everybody else, I was bored out of my mind. Blogs seemed to be outdated though, and I decided to jump in on the podcasting bandwagon. However, with the ever increasing workload that comes with pursuing two undergraduate degrees simulatenously, I had to eventually call it quits - inviting guests, recording episodes, editing them and then posting them was all too time consuming, and the opportunity cost was not worth it at that time.

Now, while my academics are still a priority, I believe it is also important for me to share my thoughts with the world. Everytime I see something amazing, interesting, controversial or even downright stupid, my brain gets overwhelmed. I write these thoughts down often using the ever handy ‘Notes’ app on my phone, but I also wonder how many other people would have similar thoughts. So while a blog’s purpose is usually to write about things other people are interested in, the purpose of this blog is for me to share thoughts that I have, in the hope that other people who have them would be interested in knowing that they are not alone.

I wrote a couple of posts directly on my website, but when sharing it with a few friends, they expressed a desire to automatically receive an email when I write something new. This was the same feedback I got when I used to maintain my earlier blog. Hence, this Substack was born.

Thanks for reading this so far, and I hope you stick around!
